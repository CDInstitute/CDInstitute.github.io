# CDI - Computational Design Institute

# WHITE PAPER

This open-source organization is based on core ethical values to create a better community in Design. It will focus on the creation of a gamefied framework where 
- happiness is the goal.
- trust is the foundation.
- transparency is the method.

People should focus on the improvement of their efficiency, not only on the technological aspect but also on how we collaborate and work.

# Logo
The Algorithm will be open-source.
Licensing system = credits to the creators of the idea, it can only be sold by the main creator. 

# Gamification
The work should be a goal and a reward-oriented. 

## Reward Structure
Helping others will have always a higher value than working on your own.
