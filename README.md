# CDI - Computational Design Institute

# WHITE PAPER

This open-source organization is based on core ethical values to create a better community in Design. It will focus on the creation of a gamefied framework where 
- happiness is the goal.
- trust is the foundation.
- transparency is the method.

People should focus on the improvement of their efficiency, not only on the technological aspect but also on how we collaborate and work.

# Logo
The Algorithm will be open-source.
Licensing system = credits to the creators of the idea, it can only be sold by the main creator. 

# Gamification
The work should be a goal and a reward-oriented. 

## Reward Structure
Helping others will have always a higher value than working on your own.

# PACKAGE

Project 0
npm install -g sass (compile scss to css) you will need to run: https://sass-lang.com/install
- sass styleshackathon.scss styleshackathon.css
- sass --watch styleshackathon.scss styleshackathon.css (in order to automatically compile the scss to css)
OPEN-BROWSER
pip install open-browser 
PIP
pip3 install -r requirements.txt (file in the folder)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Project 1
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/
Heroku
Adminer
Flask, Flask-Session, SQLAlchemy and psycopg2-binary from the requirement
set FLASK_APP=application.py
make sure to set DATABASE_URL=.... and set FLASK_DEBUG=1 and set FLASK_APP=name.py  FLASK_ENV=development on the CMD Terminal and not on Visual Studio Code

CTRL+K+C note an entire code

install psql (https://www.postgresql.org/ Version12) and use the Shell of psql
psql DATABASE_URL and inser all the information requested
\d in order to see the table created on the SQL command 
After CREATE TABLE / INSERT / SELECT * FROM books we are sure we have that table

python import.py it was done setting up the variable and cleaning the python code X as an exeption, and also the number 2 at the begginging.
